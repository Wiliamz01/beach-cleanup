        <h1><b>Beach Cleanup Initiative</b></h1>
        <h5><b>Created by William Zhang, Daniel Kim, and Karl Tang-Wang</b></h5>
        <p>

            As part of our Plastic Pollution initiative, we host public beach cleanups on the last Saturday of every month at rotating locations across the South Bay to reduce litter, protect our ocean, and raise awareness about pollution. Click here for our calendar of events with info on the location and time. Cleanups are also announced on our newsletter list and you can scroll to the bottom of this page to sign up for the newsletter.
            
            Supplies including gloves and buckets are provided by our chapter. Participants are instructed to leave natural things like seaweed and feathers on the beach, and to be careful when picking up potentially dangerous items like glass and syringes (or notify a Surfrider volunteer). Please wear comfortable clothes, a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen.
            
            At the end of the event, Surfrider coordinates to effectively remove the collected debris. We gather detailed data on the type and amount of trash collected by volunteers. This enables the Surfrider Foundation to enact campaigns and legislation that prevent trash from reaching your beach in the first place.
